# ðŸŒ¹ Emotional Growth Game

## Overview
This React-based game focuses on emotional growth through interactive mini-games. Players nurture a flower representing their emotional well-being by progressing through different challenges. The game dynamically adjusts based on the player's responses and interactions.

## Features
- **Interactive Mini-Games**: Four different challenges focusing on anger regulation, resilience, anxiety management, and emotional connection.
- **Dynamic Flower Growth**: The player's progress is visualized as a blooming flower, reflecting emotional development.
- **Engaging Storyline**: A narrative-driven experience with dialogue interactions.
- **Multiple Game Stages**: Includes introduction, main menu, various mini-games, and an ending.
- **Audio & Visual Elements**: Includes background music, sound effects, and interactive visual elements.
